description: Diagnose failed GitHub Actions runs for pi-agent-dashboard. Maps the 6-workflow taxonomy (ci.yml, ci-electron.yml, _electron-build.yml, publish.yml, sync-release-version.yml, deploy-site.yml), walks the release pipeline (prepare→publish→electron→github-release with strict needs[] contract), surfaces known failure modes (lockfile mismatch, bad Node version, CHANGELOG already-versioned, npm publish ordering, no-bash-on-Windows lint, missing node-pty prebuilds, GO/NO-GO bundle-server guard), and shows how to read `gh run` logs and retrigger failed jobs. Use when a CI run is red, a release is stuck, a workflow won't dispatch, or you need to understand which workflow does what. For triggering a release see `release-cut`; for revoking one see `release-revoke`.

# CI Troubleshoot

Diagnose CI failures for pi-agent-dashboard. The repo has 6 workflows arranged in two flows:

```
   ┌─ FLOW 1: every push ───────────────────────────────┐
   │                                                    │
   │   ci.yml                                           │
   │   ├─ ci (tests + lint + type-check)                │
   │   ├─ standalone-install-smoke-linux (matrix)       │
   │   └─ standalone-install-smoke-windows (matrix)     │
   │                                                    │
   │   deploy-site.yml  (on push if site/** changed)    │

   │   ├─ publish      (npm publish OIDC, ordered)      │

   │                                                    │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

   ┌─ MANUAL: smoke a feature branch's installer matrix ┐

   │   Safety invariants (locked by repo-lint):         │
   │   - no npm publish, no GitHub Release, no tag push │
   │   - version slug is a SemVer prerelease ranked     │
   │     BELOW base stable (electron-updater safe)      │
   │                                                    │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Full per-workflow detail: [`references/workflow-taxonomy.md`](references/workflow-taxonomy.md).

## First moves — always run these

```bash
npx tsx ./scripts/list-recent-runs.ts                  # last 10 runs across all workflows
npx tsx ./scripts/list-recent-runs.ts --failed         # only failed
npx tsx ./scripts/show-failed-run.ts <run-id>          # failed steps + log tails
npx tsx ./scripts/show-failed-run.ts                   # most recent failed run
```

These wrap `gh run list`, `gh run view --log-failed`, and similar. You need `gh auth status` to be authenticated.

> Scripts are TypeScript (cross-platform). All invocations use `npx tsx` so they work on Linux, macOS, and Windows. `tsx` is already a project dep; `gh` CLI is cross-platform.

  references/                     ├─ prepare      → see below
  common-failures.md              ├─ publish      → npm ordering
                                  ├─ electron     → matrix leg
                                  └─ github-release → asset collision
```

## Release pipeline — `publish.yml`

The release flow runs 4 jobs strictly in this order:

```
   prepare ──▶ publish ──▶ electron ──▶ github-release
   (deps     (npm OIDC,    (matrix     (creates
    + tag)    ordered)      6 legs)     Release)
```

`needs:` chains lock this order. **Do not remove `needs: [prepare, publish]` from `electron`** — the electron build's bundled server runs `npm install` for `@blackbelt-technology/*`, which must already exist on npm. Locked by `packages/shared/src/__tests__/publish-workflow-contract.test.ts`.

Full walkthrough with per-job failure modes: [`references/release-pipeline.md`](references/release-pipeline.md).

## Known failure modes

Maintained in [`references/common-failures.md`](references/common-failures.md). Headline catalog:

| Failure | Where | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----|
| `verify-lockfile-versions.mjs` fails | `prepare` | Cross-ref specifier in lockfile doesn't match bumped version | Regenerate lockfile + commit; or fix `scripts/sync-versions.js` |
| CHANGELOG already has `## [X.Y.Z]` | `prepare` | You're re-dispatching with a version that was already promoted | Bump to a new version, or revert the CHANGELOG section |
| `npm publish` 403 | `publish` | OIDC trusted publisher not configured for that package | Configure in npm web UI; or temporarily use NPM_TOKEN |
| Electron matrix leg fails | `electron` | Missing prebuild for node-pty/better-sqlite3 on that OS/arch | Check `bundle-server.mjs` GO/NO-GO guard; rebuild prebuilds |
| `shell: bash` on Windows runner | any | Lint test `no-bash-on-windows.test.ts` flags it | Remove `shell: bash` or guard with `if: runner.os != 'Windows'` |
| Electron job missing `needs:` | repo-lint | `publish-workflow-contract.test.ts` failed | Restore `needs: [prepare, publish]` |
| `Cannot find module @blackbelt-technology/...` in electron | `electron` | `publish` job didn't run or failed; bundled server can't resolve from npm | Check `publish` job — re-run only if it failed; never bypass |
| Fastify crashes in bundled server smoke | any using node | Bad Node version pinned in workflow | Bump `node-version:` to ≥ 22.18.0 |
| Loud-but-harmless `EADDRINUSE` in smoke | smoke job | Concurrent server spawns | Usually self-recovering; check next log lines |

## Reading gh logs efficiently

```bash
# Last 10 runs (all workflows, this branch)
gh run list -L 10

# Last 5 failed runs across all workflows
gh run list -L 50 | grep -E 'failure|cancelled' | head -5

# Get a specific run, only the failed steps
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# Watch a running workflow (live tail)
gh run watch <run-id>

# Re-run only the failed jobs (preserves successful ones, saves CI time)
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed

# Re-run from scratch (rare; usually for flakes)
gh run rerun <run-id>
```

`gh run view --log-failed` is the highest-leverage one — it pulls only failed-step output, which is what you want 95% of the time.

## When the failure is repo-lint

Repo-lint tests fail the `ci` job specifically. They're listed in `debug-dashboard/references/test-failure-triage.md` → "Repo-lint tests". Fix the file that violated the rule. **Don't loosen the lint** — each one exists because of a real regression.
