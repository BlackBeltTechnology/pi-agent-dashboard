## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A device bearer's tier gates REST routes and WS-ticket minting
Every `/api/*` route SHALL have a tier from a single route→tier map in
`packages/shared`; a route absent from the map SHALL require `operate`. A
request admitted via a paired-device bearer SHALL be refused with HTTP 403,
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope" scope="<tier>"` and a
logged refusal when the route's tier exceeds the row's tier. `/api/ws-ticket`
SHALL require `operate`. `POST /api/paired-devices/rotate` SHALL be entered in that map at tier `observe`, so any valid browser-held bearer, of any tier, may rotate itself; the route SHALL authenticate by that bearer and SHALL rotate only the device that bearer belongs to. Principals admitted by other means (browser cookie
session, local token) SHALL see no change. A bearer presented from a genuinely
local address SHALL NOT be tier-refused. A bearer presented from a
trusted-network address SHALL NOT be tier-refused **only when the effective
trust mode is `"legacy"`**; in `"pair"` mode a network match grants no tier
exemption. The gate SHALL only refuse; it SHALL NOT admit a request that
existing admission rules reject.

When `requireLocalProof` is in effect (the default: absent or `true`), the genuinely-local (loopback, non-forwarded) condition in this requirement is narrowed by the "Opt-in local proof for loopback trust" requirement of `trust-and-credential-boundaries`. Only with it explicitly `false` is this requirement unchanged; a scenario below that says `requireLocalProof` is disabled means it is explicitly `false`.

Routes under an enabled plugin public namespace (`/api/plugins/<id>/public/*`, see `plugin-public-routes`) SHALL be exempted from the device-bearer tier gate by an explicit namespace predicate evaluated before the map lookup; the map itself SHALL remain an exact lookup, and no new tier value SHALL be introduced. These routes never carry a device admission (the device branch does not run for them).

#### Scenario: Observe bearer cannot restart
- **WHEN** a request bearing an `observe` device token calls `POST /api/restart`
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond 403 with `WWW-Authenticate` containing `error="insufficient_scope"` and `scope="operate"`
- **AND** the restart handler SHALL NOT run

#### Scenario: Control bearer cannot mint a WS ticket
- **WHEN** a request bearing a `control` device token calls `POST /api/ws-ticket`
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond 403 with `scope="operate"`

#### Scenario: Observe bearer reads within tier
- **WHEN** a request bearing an `observe` device token calls `GET /api/sessions`
- **THEN** the request SHALL be served

#### Scenario: Browser principal unchanged
- **WHEN** a request is admitted by a browser cookie session or the local token
- **THEN** no route SHALL be refused on tier grounds

#### Scenario: Loopback bearer is not tier-refused
- **WHEN** `requireLocalProof` is disabled and a request from a genuinely local address bears an `observe` device token and calls `POST /api/restart`
- **THEN** the request SHALL NOT be refused on tier grounds

#### Scenario: Trusted-network bearer exempt only in legacy mode
- **GIVEN** `trustedNetworks: ["192.168.16.0/24"]`
- **WHEN** a request from `192.168.16.20` bears an `observe` device token and calls `POST /api/restart`
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT be tier-refused when the effective trust mode is `"legacy"`
- **AND** it SHALL be refused with 403 `scope="operate"` when the effective trust mode is `"pair"`

#### Scenario: Observe bearer may rotate itself
- **WHEN** a request bearing an unexpired `observe` browser bearer calls `POST /api/paired-devices/rotate`
- **THEN** the request SHALL NOT be refused on tier grounds
- **AND** the rotated bearer SHALL belong to the same device and carry tier `observe`

#### Scenario: Rotation never touches another device
- **WHEN** a bearer for device A calls `POST /api/paired-devices/rotate`, whatever its body
- **THEN** only device A's row SHALL be rotated and no other device's bearer SHALL change

#### Scenario: Unlisted route fails closed
- **WHEN** a route with no entry in the route→tier map is called with a `control` bearer
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond 403 with `scope="operate"`

#### Scenario: Refusal is logged
- **WHEN** a tier refusal occurs
- **THEN** a log line SHALL record the device id, method, route pattern, principal tier and required tier

#### Scenario: Public namespace skips the tier gate; other plugin routes do not
- **WHEN** the tier gate evaluates `POST /api/plugins/web-chat/public/messages` and `GET /api/plugins/web-chat/config`
- **THEN** the first SHALL be skipped by the namespace predicate and the second SHALL resolve through the exact map (default `operate`) as before

### Requirement: Bearer auth branch for REST
The server SHALL accept a valid bearer token via `Authorization: Bearer`, or via
the httpOnly `SameSite=Strict` device cookie a same-origin browser obtains by
exchanging its bearer (`POST /api/device-session`, cookie scoped to `path=/api/`), as an authentication source feeding the existing `request.isAuthenticated` decision,
WITHOUT altering the loopback, trusted-network, or OAuth cookie paths. A request
admitted by the device cookie SHALL carry the same `authVia = "device"` marker
and tier as the bearer, and revoking the device SHALL invalidate both. The durable
bearer token authenticates REST only; WebSocket upgrades authenticate via a
short-lived single-use ticket (see "WebSocket auth via single-use ticket before
upgrade") and the durable bearer SHALL NOT ride the socket.
A valid TLS-only (`pi_tls_`) bearer or device cookie presented on a non-proven
channel is the one exception: it SHALL be refused as "Bridge tokens issued on a
proven channel are TLS-only" states.

The bearer branch SHALL NOT run for a request under an enabled plugin public namespace (`/api/plugins/<id>/public/`, see `plugin-public-routes`): such a request is never authenticated by a device bearer or device cookie, and an invalid, revoked, unknown or TLS-only device bearer there SHALL NOT produce `401` from this branch. Separately, a passive exposure check SHALL still look the bearer up and, when it names a device and the channel is non-proven, record that device as exposed ("Plaintext bearer exposure is recorded"); the check SHALL NOT authenticate or refuse the request.

#### Scenario: REST request authorized by bearer
- **WHEN** a cross-origin REST request presents a valid bearer token
- **THEN** the request is marked authenticated and served

#### Scenario: WebSocket authorized via ticket, not durable bearer
- **WHEN** a client needs a WebSocket to a paired server
- **THEN** it mints a single-use ticket from an authenticated REST call and presents that ticket on the upgrade, never the durable bearer token

#### Scenario: Existing paths unaffected
- **WHEN** `requireLocalProof` is disabled and a user relies only on loopback or the OAuth cookie
- **THEN** authentication behaves exactly as before this change

#### Scenario: Invalid bearer rejected
- **WHEN** a request presents an unknown or revoked bearer token and matches no other allow path
- **THEN** the server responds 401

#### Scenario: Device cookie authenticates like the bearer

- **WHEN** a same-origin browser presents a valid device cookie and no `Authorization` header
- **THEN** the request is marked authenticated with `authVia = "device"` and the device's tier

#### Scenario: Revoked device cookie rejected

- **WHEN** a request presents the device cookie of a revoked device and matches no other allow path
- **THEN** the server responds 401

#### Scenario: TLS-only bearer refused off a proven channel
- **WHEN** a request on the main plaintext listener from a LAN address presents a valid `pi_tls_` bearer and matches no other allow path
- **THEN** the server responds 401 with error `tls_only_token_untrusted_channel`

#### Scenario: Device bearer ignored on a public namespace
- **WHEN** a request to an enabled plugin public route carries a valid, a revoked, or an unknown device bearer
- **THEN** the bearer branch SHALL NOT authenticate or refuse it

#### Scenario: Plaintext bearer on a public namespace is still recorded as exposed
- **WHEN** a request on the plaintext listener to an enabled plugin public route carries a valid `pi_tls_` device bearer
- **THEN** that device SHALL be recorded as exposed, with an audit line naming the device id prefix and channel
- **AND** the request SHALL be neither authenticated by the bearer nor refused because of it
